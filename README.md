# Anti Scammer Toolset (AST)
I hate scam websites phishing for user details, so this bot (with some configuration) will send millions of fake records to the scammer's API to (hopefully) slow them down.

# Tools
* HTTP flooder + Data Generator (to take the shittest scam webservers down)
* Pixel Tracker (for replying to scammers on email)

# Branches
* main - Will contain the latest stable release.
* develop - Always latest "working" (maybe) code.
* feature - I might use feature branches, depends on how I feel. Since it's just me working on this right now, just stick with the develop branch.

# Setup & Install
1) Clone this repo
2) Open repo in your fav text or code editor (VS Code recommended!)
3) Run `npm install`
4) Run `npm run start`
